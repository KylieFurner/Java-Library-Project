# Overview

This was my first java project I ever worked on and I wanted to do something relevant to my interests.I have been reading a lot lately so I decided on making a login page for a library! It stores usernames and passwords in 2 txt files and also creates an account for each new user (a txt file titled after the username) The loops and conditionals in this project check all inputs
and send error messages if anything is incorrect. This project was a great opportunity to learn more about files since it uses reading, writing, and file creation


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to write this program
I imported Java libraries such as Scanner, LocalDate, Files, IO exception catchers, ArrayLists, and Bufferwriter

# Future Work

Things I would like to add to this project if I continued working on it
* another loop to go back and forth between viewing the account and checking out a book without rerunning the program
* A way to logout and then login to another account
* The ability to change a forgotten password
